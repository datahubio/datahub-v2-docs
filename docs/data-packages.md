title: Data Packages

A Data Package (or DataPackage) is a simple way of "packaging" up data.

To create a Data Package, all you need to do is place a "descriptor" file named
`datapackage.json` in the top-level directory of your set of data files.

#### Why Data Packages? How Can They Help?

Imagine a situation such as the following:

* You have a set of data files in a directory (and subdirectories) - whether
  locally or online
* You want to provide basic info for this collection (the "dataset") - perhaps
  you want to publish this data for others, or simply to manage it better
  yourself
* Information like: author, license, list of files in the dataset (and possibly
  info on those files, like a schema)

The Data Package approach provides a **very simple**, **web friendly**,
**standardized** and **extensible**, way for you to do this.

### Full Spec

There is a full **[RFC-style specification of Data Package format](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/)**
on the Frictionless Data website to complement this quick introduction.

### Tabular Data

**[Tabular Data Package](/docs/data-packages/tabular/)** extends Data Packages for tabular data. It supports providing additional information such as data types
of columns.

### Tools

There is a growing set of [online and offline tools](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) for working with Data
Packages including for creating, viewing and validating.

## Getting Started

A minimal example Data Package would look like this on disk:

    datapackage.json
    # a data file (CSV in this case but could be any type of data)
    data.csv
    # (Optional!) A README (in markdown format)
    README.md

Any number of additional files such as more data files, scripts (for processing
or analyzing the data) and other material may be provided but are not required.

## datapackage.json

`datapackage.json` is the file that makes a Data Package a Data Package
(and is the only required file). It provides:

* General metadata such as the name of the package, its license, its publisher
  etc
* A "manifest" in the the form of a list of the data resources (data files)
  included in this data package along with information on those files (e.g.
  size and schema)

As its file extension indicates it must be a [JSON][] file. Here's a very
minimal example of a `datapackage.json` file:

    {
      "name": "a-unique-human-readable-and-url-usable-identifier",
      "title": "A nice title",
      "resources": [{
        # see below for what a resource descriptor looks like
      }]
    }

Here is a much more extensive example of a datapackage JSON file:

:::info
**Note:** a complete list of potential attributes and their meaning can be found in the
[full Data Package spec][spec].

:::info
**Note:** the Data Package format is **extensible** in that it allows you add
your own attributes to the `datapackage.json`
:::

    {
      "name": "a-unique-human-readable-and-url-usable-identifier",
      "title": "A nice title",
      "description": "...",
      "version": "2.0",
      "keywords": ["name", "My new keyword"],
      "licenses": [{
        "path": "http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/",
        "title": "Open Data Commons Public Domain",
        "name": "ODC-PDDL-1.0"
      }]
      "sources": [{
        "title": "World Bank and OECD",
        "path": "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD"
      }],
      "contributors":[ {
        "title": "Joe Bloggs",
        "email": "joe@bloggs.com",
        "path": "http://www.bloggs.com",
        "role": "author"
      }],
      "resources": [
        {
          ... see below ...
        }
      ],
      # extend your datapackage.json with attributes that are not
      # part of the data package spec
      # we add a views attribute to display Recline Dataset Graph Views
      # in our Data Package Viewer
      "views" : [
        {
          ... see below ...
        }
      ],
      # you can add your own attributes to a datapackage.json, too
      "my-own-attribute": "data-packages-are-awesome",
    }

### Resources

You list data files in the resources entry of the datapackage.json.

    {
      # path may be a relative file path or a rul
      path: "relative-path-to-file" # e.g. data/mydata.csv
      # or ... url 
      path: "online url" # e.g http://mysite.org/some-data.csv
    }

### Views

The [Data Package Viewer](http://data.okfn.org/tools/view) will display a [Recline Dataset Graph View](http://okfnlabs.org/recline/docs/views.html) when a `views` entry is provided in the datapackage.json.

* Include the `resourceName` property if you have more than one resource and want to display a graph for a resource other than the first resource

* In the `state` property
  * the `group` property is the name of the resource field whose values will be used on the y axis in the `bars` graph type and the x axis in all other graph types
  * the `series` property is an array of one or more names of resource fields whose values will be used on the x axis in the `bars` graph type and the y axis in all other graph types
  * the `graphType` may be one of `lines-and-points`, `lines`, `points`, `bars`, or `columns`

```json
{
  "id": "graph",
  "label": "Graph",
  "resourceName": "a-resource-name",
  "type": "Graph",
  "state": {
    "group": "a-resource-field-name",
    "series": [
      "another-resource-field-name"
    ],
    "graphType": "lines-and-points"
  }
}
```

## Examples

Many exemplar data packages can be found in the [datasets organization on
github][datasets]. Specific examples:

### [World GDP][]

A Data Package which includes the data locally in the repo (data is CSV).

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/gdp/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>

### [S&P 500 Companies Data][sp500]

This is an example with more than one resource in the data package.

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>
