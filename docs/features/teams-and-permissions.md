Currently, this feature is under development. However, we can create organization accounts upon request - it's absolutely free!

## How it works

1. **You contact us:** providing us preferred username, email address and a small description of your organization. Note that we use a gravatar associated with provided email
2. **We create an account:** we process your information and create an account
3. **We send you credentials:** we send you back encrypted credentials that can be used to publish datasets
